        This is was an assignment I had my senior year of highschool
        <br>
        Post high school I’m going to be studying either Cyber Security or Electrical Engineering. My three things I enjoy include playing video games, watching shows I like and my cats and dog. I tend to work alone, this year I hope to change that. I mainly struggle from ADD, Anxiety and Depression among others which can have an impact on my school work. This year I'm planning to overcome that and be able to always do my work.
        <br>
        Most of this still stands true, I also enjoy working on personal projects. Right now I'm working on a ripperdoc glove from the cyberpunk universe. Compared to then, I would think I'm a social butterfly. That is not true, I still have a long way to go and hope college will assist with that.<br>
